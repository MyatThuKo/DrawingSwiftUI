<h1> Day 46 of 100 Days of SwiftUI </h1> 
<h3> Project 9, Challenge Day </h3> 
<p> 
Today is a challenge day and had to complete the following. 
<ol> 
<li> Create an Arrow shape made from a rectangle and a triangle – having it point straight up is fine </li> 
<li> Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable Create an Arrow shape made from a rectangle and a triangle – having it point straight up is fine</li> 
<li> Create a ColorCyclingRectangle shape that is the rectangular cousin of ColorCyclingCircle, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using a property </li> 
</ol> 
I made the arrow rotatable from -360 to 360 degrees.
